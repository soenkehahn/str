- Rename project to something that's easier to google
- set up eslint
- setup tsc for example
- Set up CI for different node versions
- Show statistics of failing and passing tests at the end
- Allow test-suites in nested directories
- dry-run
- Allow to typecheck with tsc against library
- Better error message when `str` library can't be found
- Allow to use dependencies in test-suites
  - local ones
  - from npm
