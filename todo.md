- Set up CI for different node versions
- Catch exceptions during tests
  - and pop the description stack
- Show statistics of failing and passing tests at the end
- Nice colors in output
- Allow test-suites in nested directories
- Implement `describe`
- dry-run
- Allow to typecheck with tsc against library
- Better error message when `str` library can't be found
- Allow multiple test-suite files
- Allow to use dependencies in test-suites
  - local ones
  - from npm
